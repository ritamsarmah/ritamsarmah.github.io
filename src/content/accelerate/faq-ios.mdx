## Getting Started

<Disclosure summary="How do I start using Accelerate?">

In the Settings app, enable the Safari extension by going to **Safari > Extensions > Accelerate** and toggling "Accelerate" on.

Accelerate allows you to control video playback in Safari on iOS 15+ via a popup menu or keyboard shortcuts. Access the popup by tapping Accelerate's icon in the Safari toolbar.

The following playback controls are supported (default shortcuts in parentheses):

- Speed Up (**D**)
- Slow Down (**S**)
- Toggle Speed (**R**)
- Show Speed (**V**)
- Play/Pause
- Skip Forward
- Skip Backward
- Skip to End
- Toggle Mute
- Toggle Picture in Picture (**P**)
- Toggle Fullscreen

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="How do I customize my shortcuts?">

You can customize your shortcuts in the **Shortcuts** tab of Accelerate's preferences.

- To *create a new shortcut*, tap "**+**".
- To *remove a shortcut*, swipe left to delete.
- To *modify a shortcut*, select it to access the following options:
   - **Action**: The triggered action (e.g., speed up, skip forward).
   - **Shortcut**: A single key or combination of regular and modifier keys, like command (⌘), option (⌥), or control (⌃), that trigger the shortcut.
   - **Show Notification**: Display notification on the webpage when shortcut is triggered.
   - **Show in Popup Menu**: Include shortcut in Accelerate's toolbar popup.
   - Certain actions also require an associated value, e.g., "Toggle Speed" or "Skip Forward".

After making changes, refresh any open webpages to update.

<Disclosure summary="How do I customize other preferences, like default speed?">

You can configure general preferences in the **General** tab:

- **Notification location** on the webpage after triggering a shortcut. Set to "Hidden" to disable notifications.
- **Default speed** for video playback. Default is 1x speed.
- **Minimum/maximum speed** for video adjustment.

After making changes, refresh any open webpages to update.

## Troubleshooting

<Disclosure summary="Why isn't Accelerate working for me?">

1. Check that the extension is enabled in the Settings app: **Safari > Extensions > Accelerate**. Make sure the switch next to "Accelerate" is toggled on and you've granted Accelerate permission to run on your desired websites. If you want to enable Accelerate on all websites, make sure **All Websites** is set to **Allow**.
2. If you have other extensions installed, check that they aren't interfering with Accelerate by disabling them, restarting Safari, and testing if Accelerate works.

<Disclosure summary="Why aren't my updated shortcuts or preferences working?">

After making changes to preferences, refresh any open websites. If the changes still aren't applied, try restarting Safari.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="Why isn't my updated textfield preference being saved?">

After changing a textfield in preferences, such as "Default Speed" or a shortcut's value, **press Done/Return to confirm**. Tap "Save" after editing a shortcut.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="Why does the video briefly lag after changing speed or skipping?">

Safari pauses videos for a split second when adjusting playback. This behavior occurs even without Accelerate, e.g., when using a website's integrated video controls. Since this is due to Safari's video processing, the issue currently cannot be fixed by Accelerate.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="How can I disable Accelerate from running on a website?">

You can add a website to Accelerate's blocklist to prevent the extension from running on it. This can be useful for certain websites that are incompatible with Accelerate.
