</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="How do I customize my shortcuts?">

You can customize your shortcuts in the **Shortcuts** tab of Accelerate's preferences.

- To *create a new shortcut*, click "**+**". You can create up to 30 shortcuts.
- To *remove a shortcut*, select it from the list and click "**–**".
- To *modify a shortcut*, double-click it to access the following options:
   - **Shortcut action**: The triggered action (e.g., speed up, skip forward).
   - **Key combination**: A single key or combination of regular and modifier keys, like command (⌘), option (⌥), or control (⌃), that trigger the shortcut.
   - **Enable global shortcut**: Enables shortcuts with modifier key combinations to be triggered while Safari is not in focus.
   - **Show notification**: Display notification on the webpage when shortcut is triggered.
   - **Show in right-click menu**: Allows triggering the shortcut from the right-click menu.
   - Certain actions also require an associated value, e.g., "Toggle Speed" or "Skip Forward".

After making changes, refresh any open webpages to update.

- **Default speed** for video playback. Default is 1x speed.
- **Minimum/maximum speed** for video adjustment.

After making changes, refresh any open webpages to update.

## Troubleshooting

<Disclosure summary="Why isn't Accelerate working for me?">

If you are experiencing issues with the Accelerate extension, please follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. Check that the extension is enabled in Safari's extension preferences: **Safari > Preferences > Extensions**. In the sidebar, make sure the checkbox next to "Accelerate" is checked.
2. If Accelerate is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Accelerate.
3. If you have other extensions installed, check that they aren't interfering with Accelerate by disabling them, restarting Safari, and testing if Accelerate works. 
4. If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.
5. If you continue to have issues, feel free to email me.

<Disclosure summary="Why aren't my updated shortcuts or preferences working?">

After making changes to preferences, refresh any open websites. If the changes still aren't applied, try restarting Safari.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="Why isn't my updated textfield preference being saved?">

After changing a textfield in preferences, such as "Default Speed" or a shortcut's value, **press Enter/Return to confirm**. Click "Save" after editing a shortcut.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="Why doesn't right-click work on Netflix (or some other site)?">

Netflix and some other sites block users from accessing the right-click menu. There are Safari extensions that prevent sites from doing this, but otherwise you'll have to use the keyboard shortcuts or toolbar item for controls.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="Why aren't playback controls working properly on Netflix (or some other site)?">

Some sites use custom video players that modify standard playback behavior. For example, Netflix may freeze when skipping forward or backward with Accelerate. Use the website's playback controls for a smoother experience.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="Why does the video briefly lag after changing speed or skipping?">

Safari pauses videos for a split second when adjusting playback. This behavior occurs even without Accelerate, e.g., when using a website's integrated video controls. Since this is due to Safari's video processing, the issue currently cannot be fixed by Accelerate.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="Why does the audio quality degrade at higher speeds?">

This is a limitation of Safari's pitch correction algorithm. The issue occurs even when using other methods to change video speed, like YouTube's playback settings.

</Disclosure>

<Disclosure summary="How can I disable Accelerate from running on a website?">

You can add a website to Accelerate's blocklist to prevent the extension from running on it. This can be useful for certain websites that are incompatible with Accelerate.
