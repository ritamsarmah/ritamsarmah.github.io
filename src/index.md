# Hello! I'm Ritam.

I am a software engineer from California, currently working at [AppLovin](https://www.applovin.com). In my spare time, I enjoy building useful apps for iOS and macOS. I graduated from UCLA, where I studied computer science and pursued research in [human-computer interaction](https://hci.ucla.edu).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or just want to say hello.
