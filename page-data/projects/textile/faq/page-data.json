Here is a list of all the available features with descriptions on how to use them.</p>\n<h4>Automatically correct spelling</h4>\n<p>Automatically fixes spelling errors in the extracted text. You can add custom words to the spell-checker's dictionary in Preferences > General.</p>\n<h4>Group text by line or paragraph</h4>\n<p>Textile intelligently groups text and approximates spacing based on the document layout. You can choose from two grouping methods, described below, each with their own options for configuration.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Group by line</h3>\n<p>This method keeps words on the same baseline together.</p>\n<h4>Preserve whitespace around words</h4>\n<p>Approximates line indentation and spacing between words from original layout. Works best on left-aligned text, e.g., code snippets or essays.</p>\n<br>\n<h3>Group by paragraph</h3>\n<p>This method clusters text into paragraphs based on user-specified line spacing.</p>\n<h4>Organize paragraphs by column</h4>\n<p>Sort the paragraphs column-wise, starting from the left-most column. Useful for maintaining the reading order of text formatted into two or more columns.</p>\n<h4>Remove line breaks in paragraphs</h4>\n<p>By default, Textile will preserve line breaks within paragraphs to resemble the original layout. This option removes those line breaks, while maintaining the spacing between paragraphs.</p>\n<h4>Join words hyphenated at line breaks</h4>\n<p>Automatically join words that have been split by a hyphen across line breaks in a paragraph, e.g., \"hel-lo\" split across two lines would become \"hello\" in the transcript. This option is only available if \"Remove line breaks in paragraphs\" is enabled.</p>\n<h4>Line spacing</h4>\n<p>The approximate spacing between lines of text, as a percentage of the original document's height. This allows Textile to determine which lines of text belong in the same paragraph. Intuitively, larger values mean lines of text is more spaced out, while smaller values mean text is closer together.</p>\n</details>\n<br>\n<h2>Troubleshooting Issues</h2>\n<details>\n<summary>Why is the text recognition sometimes inaccurate?</summary>\n While optical character recognition (OCR) technology has come a long way in the past few years, it is still prone to making errors. Textile works best on clear, uniform text; handwritten or misshapen text, complex layouts, and low resolution files may increase the likelihood of errors in the transcript.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why isn't Textile's Safari extension enabled/working for me?</summary>\n<ol>\n  <li>Check that the extension is enabled by opening Safari's extension preferences: Safari > Preferences > Extensions. In the sidebar on the left, make sure the checkbox next to \"Textile\" is checked.\n  <li>If Textile is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Textile.</li>\n  <li>If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.</li>\n  <li>If you continue to have issues, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:hello@ritam.me\">email me</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<br>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<details>\n<summary>What if I have a different question or feedback?</summary>\nFeel free to send me any other questions, comments, feedback, or bug reports via <a href=\"mailto:hello@ritam.me\">email</a>.\n</details>","frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ"}},"projectsYaml":{"name":"Textile","theme":{"colors":{"accent":"#57F4FC","bg":"#131324","text":"white"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/textile/faq/","project":"Textile"}}}
