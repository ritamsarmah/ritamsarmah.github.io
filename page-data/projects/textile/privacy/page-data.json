Text recognition, also known as optical character recognition (OCR), runs locally on your computer using Apple's Vision framework so your files and text results never leave your device.</p>\n<h4>Why does Safari warn me that the Textile extension can read sensitive info from all webpages?</h4>\n<p>Safari shows this general warning for extensions that load JavaScript into all web pages, which includes most extensions on the Mac App Store. In the case of Textile, the extension runs code that allows you to right-click on any image to allow you to extract text from it. Apple rightfully cautions the user in case a malicious extension tries to abuse this permission; however, Textile never attempts to read any sensitive info from a webpage, and does not need to collect any data to function.
