The default controls are:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>D</strong>: Speed up</li>\n<li><strong>S</strong>: Slow down</li>\n<li><strong>R</strong>: Reset to default speed</li>\n<li><strong>A</strong>: Toggle to your preferred speed</li>\n<li><strong>V</strong>: Show current playback speed</li>\n</ul>\n<p>These shortcuts can be modified in Accelerate's preferences, where you can create additional shortcuts to play/pause, skip forward/backward, and skip to the end of the video (e.g., for skipping ads). You can also right-click on a video to adjust playback speed or use the toolbar item to toggle to your preferred speed.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>How do I configure preferences in Accelerate?</summary>\nYou can access Accelerate's preferences by opening the Accelerate application, say from Launchpad or Spotlight. Here are some options configurable under the General tab:\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>default speed</strong> to automatically start playing videos at. Videos normally play at 1x speed by default.</li>\n<li>The <strong>preferred speed</strong> to toggle to after pressing the keyboard shortcut, toolbar item, or right-click menu option.</li>\n<li>The <strong>speed interval</strong> to change by when speeding up or slowing down playback.</li>\n<li>The <strong>skip interval</strong> (in seconds) to change by when skipping forward or skipping back.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After making changes to your preferences, refresh any currently open webpages to update.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>How do I configure shortcuts in Accelerate?</summary>\nOpen up Accelerate's preferences and switch to the Shortcuts tab. Here you can configure two kinds of shortcuts to trigger each control option:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Single-key shortcuts</strong>, which require a single key press on the keyboard. Configure by typing in the textfield directly to the right of each option.</li>\n<li><strong>Modifier-key shortcuts</strong>, which require pressing a combination of regular and modifier keys, like command (⌘) or control (⌃). Configure by clicking \"Record Shortcut\" to the right of the textfields.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After making changes to your shortcuts, refresh any currently open webpages to update.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Which websites work with Accelerate?</summary>\nAccelerate works on any website using HTML5 video, which includes most modern sites like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Vimeo, and Facebook. Accelerate does not support Flash video.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why can't I use right-click controls on Netflix or some other site?</summary>\nNetflix and certain other sites block users from accessing the right-click menu. There are some Safari extensions that can prevent sites from doing this, but otherwise you'll have to use the keyboard shortcuts or toolbar item for controls.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why aren't playback controls working properly on Netflix or some other site?</summary>\nThe site is probably using a custom video player that modifies the standard playback control behavior. For example, the Netflix video player will sometimes freeze when using Accelerate's forward and backward skipping. As a result, your own playback keyboard shortcuts might not work perfectly, and you'll just have to use theirs.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why aren't my updated keyboard shortcuts or preferences working?</summary>\nAfter you make changes to any of Accelerate's preferences, refresh any currently open websites to see the updates. If the changes still aren't showing, try restarting Safari.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why isn't Accelerate enabled/working for me?</summary>\n<ol>\n  <li>Check that the extension is enabled by opening Safari's extension preferences: Safari > Preferences > Extensions. In the sidebar on the left, make sure the checkbox next to \"Accelerate\" is checked.\n  <li>If Accelerate is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Accelerate.</li>\n  <li>If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.</li>\n  <li>If you continue to have issues, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:hello@ritam.me\">email me</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>What if I have a different question or feedback?</summary>\nFeel free to send me any other questions, comments, feedback, or bug reports via <a href=\"mailto:hello@ritam.me\">email</a>.\n</details>","frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ"}},"projectsYaml":{"name":"Accelerate","theme":{"colors":{"accent":"#7252DF","bg":"white","text":"black"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/accelerate/faq/","project":"Accelerate"}}}
