If you're using an earlier version, please refer to this <a href=\"/projects/accelerate/v3/faq\">page</a>.</p>\n<h2>Getting Started</h2>\n<details>\n<summary>How do I get started with Accelerate?</summary>\nAccelerate allows you to control video playback primarily using keyboard shortcuts. The following actions are available, with default keys listed in parentheses:\n<ul>\n<li>Speed up (<strong>D</strong>)</li>\n<li>Slow down (<strong>S</strong>)</li>\n<li>Toggle default speed (<strong>R</strong>)</li>\n<li>Toggle 2x speed (<strong>A</strong>)</li>\n<li>Show current playback speed (<strong>V</strong>)</li>\n<li>Play/pause</li>\n<li>Skip forward</li>\n<li>Skip backward</li>\n<li>Skip to the end, e.g., skip ads</li>\n<li>Mute</li>\n<li>\n<p>Picture-in-Picture (<strong>P</strong>)</p>\n</details>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<details>\n<summary>How do I manage and customize my shortcuts?</summary>\nYou can modify your shortcuts in the \"Shortcuts\" tab of Accelerate's preferences.\n<ul>\n<li>To <strong>create a new shortcut</strong>, click the \"<strong>+</strong>\". You can create up to 30 shortcuts.</li>\n<li>To <strong>remove a shortcut</strong>, select the shortcut in the list and click the \"<strong>–</strong>\". You may also double-click the shortcut and click \"Delete\" in the window that appears.</li>\n<li>\n<p>To <strong>modify an existing shortcut</strong>, double-click the shortcut in the list. A window will appear with the following customization options:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Shortcut action</em>: The action triggered by the shortcut (e.g., speed up, skip forward)</li>\n<li><em>Key combination</em>: The key combination associated with the shortcut. This can be a single key, or a combination of regular and modifier keys, like command (⌘), option (⌥), or control (⌃)</li>\n<li><em>Enable global shortcut</em>: If enabled, shortcuts with modifier key combinations can be triggered while Safari is not in focus.</li>\n<li><em>Show notification</em>: If enabled, an icon will appear on the webpage when the shortcut is triggered.</li>\n<li><em>Show in right-click menu</em>: If enabled, the shortcut can be triggered from the right-click menu.</li>\n<li>Certain actions will have an associated value, for example, \"Toggle Speed\" requires a corresponding speed, and \"Skip Forward/Backward\" requires the time interval in seconds.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After making changes to your shortcuts, refresh any currently open webpages to update.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>How do I customize the toolbar button action?</summary>\nYou can set Accelerate's button in the Safari toolbar to trigger a shortcut when you click on it. Go to the \"Shortcuts\" tab and select a shortcut from the popup menu for \"Toolbar button action\".\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>How do I configure other Accelerate settings?</summary>\nYou can configure general preferences in the \"General\" tab:\n<ul>\n<li>The <strong>notification location</strong> on the webpage after triggering a shortcut with Accelerate. You can also disable all notifications by setting this to \"None\".</li>\n<li>The <strong>default playback speed</strong> for videos to start playing at. Videos normally play at 1x speed by default.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>After making changes to your preferences, refresh any currently open webpages to update.</p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Which websites work with Accelerate?</summary>\nAccelerate works on any website using HTML5 video, which includes most modern sites like YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Apple TV+, Amazon Prime Video, Twitch, and Facebook. Accelerate does not support Flash video.\n</details>\n<br>\n<h2>Troubleshooting Issues</h2>\n<details>\n<summary>Why aren't my updated keyboard shortcuts or preferences working?</summary>\nAfter you make changes to any of Accelerate's preferences, refresh any currently open websites to see the updates. If the changes still aren't showing, try restarting Safari.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why isn't Accelerate enabled/working for me?</summary>\n<ol>\n  <li>Check that the extension is enabled by opening Safari's extension preferences: Safari > Preferences > Extensions. In the sidebar on the left, make sure the checkbox next to \"Accelerate\" is checked.\n  <li>If Accelerate is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Accelerate.</li>\n  <li>If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.</li>\n  <li>If you continue to have issues, feel free to email me.</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why can't I use right-click controls on Netflix or some other site?</summary>\nNetflix and certain other sites block users from accessing the right-click menu. There are some Safari extensions that can prevent sites from doing this, but otherwise you'll have to use the keyboard shortcuts or toolbar item for controls.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why aren't playback controls working properly on Netflix or some other site?</summary>\nThe site is probably using a custom video player that modifies the standard playback control behavior. For example, the Netflix video player will sometimes freeze when skipping forward or backward using Accelerate. As a result, your own playback keyboard shortcuts might not work perfectly, and you'll have to use theirs to ensure a smooth experience.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why does the video briefly lag after changing speed or skipping?</summary>\nBy default, videos in Safari pause for a split second anytime the user adjusts playback, such as when changing speed or skipping forward. You may notice this behavior on videos even without Accelerate; for example, when using a website's integrated controls for a video. Since this is a result of Safari's video processing, this issue currently cannot be fixed by Accelerate.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why does the audio quality degrade at higher speeds?</summary>\nThis is unfortunately a limitation of Safari's pitch correction algorithm when processing videos. This issue can be observed when changing the video speed using other methods apart from Accelerate; for example, when using YouTube's built in settings for playback speed.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>How can I disable Accelerate from running on incompatible or specific websites?</summary>\nIf a certain website is not compatible with Accelerate, you can add the website's domain to Accelerate's blocklist to prevent the extension from running on it. Feel free to also send me an email to let me know about the issue. \n</details>\n<br>\n<h2>Miscellaneous</h2>\n<details>\n<summary>Can I use Accelerate for Safari on iPhone or iPad?</summary>\n<p>Starting from iOS 15, extensions are now supported by mobile Safari. The mobile version of Accelerate is in development and will be coming soon!</p>\n<p>For older devices, a simple solution to change video speed is to use a bookmarklet, which is just a bookmark that runs JavaScript code when you \"open\" it. The following bookmarklet will show an alert allowing you to enter a new speed value. Create a new bookmark in Safari on any website, and replace the bookmark URL with the following code:\n<br><br>\n<code>\njavascript:%20(function%20()%20%7B%20%C2%A0%20var%20videos%20=%20Array.from(document.getElementsByTagName('video'));%20%C2%A0%20var%20rate%20=%20prompt(%22Enter%20playback%20speed%20(default%20is%201)%22,%202);%20%C2%A0%20if%20(rate%20!=%20null)%20%7B%20%C2%A0%20%C2%A0%20%C2%A0%20videos.forEach(v%20=%3E%20v.playbackRate%20=%20rate);%20%C2%A0%20%7D%20%7D());\n</code></p>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>What if I have a different question or feedback?</summary>\nFeel free to send me any other questions, comments, feedback, or bug reports via email.\n</details>","frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ"}},"projectsYaml":{"name":"Accelerate","theme":{"colors":{"accent":"#7252DF","bg":"white","text":"black"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/accelerate/faq/","project":"Accelerate"}},"staticQueryHashes":["63159454"]}
