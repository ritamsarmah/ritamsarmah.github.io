Accelerate does not support Flash video.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why can't I use right-click controls on Netflix or some other site?</summary>\nNetflix and certain other sites block users from accessing the right-click menu. There are some Safari extensions that can prevent sites from doing this, but otherwise you'll have to use the keyboard shortcuts or toolbar item for controls.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why aren't playback controls working properly on Netflix or some other site?</summary>\nThe site is probably using a custom video player that modifies the standard playback control behavior. For example, the Netflix video player will sometimes freeze when using Accelerate's forward and backward skipping. As a result, your own playback keyboard shortcuts might not work perfectly, and you'll just have to use theirs.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why aren't my updated keyboard controls or preferences working?</summary>\nAfter you make changes to Accelerate's preferences, refresh any currently open websites to see the updates. If the changes still aren't showing, try restarting Safari.\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>Why isn't Accelerate enabled/working for me?</summary>\n<ol>\n  <li>Check that the extension is enabled by opening Safari's extension preferences: Safari > Preferences > Extensions. In the sidebar on the left, make sure the checkbox next to \"Accelerate\" is checked.\n  <li>If Accelerate is already enabled, try unchecking the checkbox and restarting Safari. Once Safari re-opens, re-enable Accelerate.</li>\n  <li>If it is still not working, try deleting and reinstalling.</li>\n  <li>If you continue to have issues, feel free to <a href=\"mailto:hello@ritam.me\">email me</a>.</li>\n</ol>\n</details>\n<details>\n<summary>What if I have a different question or feedback?</summary>\nFeel free to send me any other questions, comments, feedback, or bug reports via <a href=\"mailto:hello@ritam.me\">email</a>.\n</details>","frontmatter":{"title":"FAQ"}},"projectsYaml":{"theme":{"colors":{"accent":"#7252DF","bg":"white","text":"black"}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/projects/accelerate/faq/","project":"Accelerate"}}}
