In the case of Accelerate, the extension runs code that finds videos on each page you visit, and adds your playback options to control them. Apple rightfully cautions the user in case a malicious extension tries to abuse this permission; however, Accelerate never attempts to read any sensitive info from a webpage, and does not need to collect any data to function.
